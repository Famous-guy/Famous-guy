# 👨‍💻 Gideon — Mobile Engineer | Backend Enthusiast | Web3 Innovator

Welcome to my portfolio!  
I’m **Gideon**, a passionate **Mobile Engineer** who loves turning complex ideas into smooth, elegant, and high-performance digital products.  
With experience spanning **Flutter**, **FastAPI**, and **Web3**, I focus on building scalable systems that balance functionality, performance, and clean design.

## 🚀 About Me

I’m driven by a passion for technology that makes life simpler.  
From crafting sleek **Flutter mobile apps** to architecting robust **FastAPI backends**, I bridge design and logic to deliver complete digital experiences.  

My journey started in **frontend development**, but curiosity and real-world project needs led me into **backend architecture**, **API design**, and **blockchain integration** — allowing me to build full-stack solutions that scale.
