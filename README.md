# 👋 Hey, I'm Gideon

I’m a **Mobile Engineer** who loves building smooth, fast, and meaningful products.  
I mostly work with **Flutter** on the frontend and **Go (Golang)** on the backend.  
Over time, I’ve learned to balance clean code with real-world practicality — things that actually scale and make users happy.

## 🚀 A Bit About Me

I started out writing frontend code and building UI stuff for fun.  
That curiosity pushed me deeper into how things work behind the scenes — so I picked up backend development with Go, where I now focus on writing efficient and maintainable APIs.  

I like solving problems, experimenting with architecture, and working on products that impact people.  
When I’m not coding, I’m probably learning something new or improving something old.
